[Dynamic DevOps Roadmap](https://github.com/DevOpsHiveHQ/dynamic-devops-roadmap) is a **FREE** pragmatic DevOps learning to kickstart your DevOps career in the Cloud Native era following the Agile MVP style!

Unlike many other roadmaps, this roadmap is **effective**, **impactful**, and most importantly **feasible** because it takes a different approach following 3 principles:

- `Progressive`: Real-world experience that matches the job market using an MVP-style learning path works in phases. Acquire skills that employers value.
- `Non-Linear`: Landing jobs faster and more solid growth in less time than traditional methods. Get ahead of your peers with better strategies.
- `T-Shaped`: Gaining depth of expertise and breadth of knowledge. Get into jobs like DevOps, DevSecOps, Cloud, SRE, Platform, DataOps, MLOps, and more.
